## 🧠 What is **System Python**?

**System Python** refers to the **default Python interpreter** that comes **pre-installed with your operating system** (Linux, macOS, sometimes Windows).

### 🔍 Details

* It’s usually located in `/usr/bin/python` or `/usr/bin/python3`.
* It’s part of the OS itself — many **system utilities and packages** depend on it.
* Modifying or upgrading it manually can **break** your system tools.

### ⚙️ Example (Linux)

```bash
$ which python3
/usr/bin/python3

$ python3 --version
Python 3.10.12
```

This `python3` is your **system Python** — the one managed by your OS package manager (like `apt`, `dnf`, or `brew`).

### 💡 Important Note

When you install a new version of Python manually (e.g., via pyenv, conda, or source), it becomes a **user Python**, not the system one.

## 🧩 What is **CPython**?

**CPython** is the **official and default implementation** of the Python language — written in **C**.

In simpler terms:

> 🧩 CPython = the original and most common “engine” that runs your Python code.

---

### 🔍 How It Works

When you run:

```bash
python my_script.py
```

Here’s what happens under the hood with **CPython**:

1. **Lexing/Parsing** → Your code is converted to an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.
2. **Compilation** → The AST is compiled into **bytecode** (`.pyc` files).
3. **Execution** → The CPython **Virtual Machine (VM)** interprets that bytecode line by line in C.

---

### 🧱 Architecture of CPython

```
Your Code (Python)
     ↓
 [Parser + Compiler]
     ↓
   Bytecode (.pyc)
     ↓
 [CPython VM / Interpreter]
     ↓
 OS (via C API)
```

So CPython = **compiler + interpreter** implemented in C.

### 📦 Features of CPython

* It’s what you get when you type `python` or `python3` on almost every system.
* Supports **C extensions** (like NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow).
* Well-optimized and stable.
* Reference implementation — defines how Python “should” behave.

### 🆚 Other Python Implementations

| Implementation                  | Language         | Key Use Case                         |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **CPython**                     | C                | Default, most common                 |
| **PyPy**                        | Python (RPython) | JIT compilation → faster performance |
| **Jython**                      | Java             | Run Python code on the JVM           |
| **IronPython**                  | C#               | Run Python on .NET                   |
| **MicroPython / CircuitPython** | C                | For microcontrollers (IoT devices)   |

So:
✅ All of these follow **Python language specs**,
🚀 But they have **different internal engines**.

### ⚙️ Relationship Between System Python & CPython

| Concept           | Meaning                                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **System Python** | The *installed instance* of Python that your OS uses.                 |
| **CPython**       | The *implementation* (written in C) that powers that Python instance. |

So on almost all systems:

> **System Python = CPython interpreter installed with your OS**

---

### 🧩 Example

Let’s confirm what interpreter you’re running:

```bash
$ python3 -c "import platform; print(platform.python_implementation())"
CPython
```

✅ Output: `CPython` → means your current Python interpreter is the CPython engine.

## **Python Practice Questions: Error Handling**

---

### **1. Basics of Exceptions (5 Questions)**

1. Write a program that catches a `ZeroDivisionError`.
2. Write a program that catches a `ValueError` when converting a string to int.
3. Write a program that catches multiple exceptions (`ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError`).
4. Write a program that triggers a `TypeError` and handles it.
5. Write a program that uses the base `Exception` class to catch any error.

### **2. try/except/else/finally (5 Questions)**

6. Write a program that uses `try/except/else` to open a file and print its contents.
7. Write a program that uses `try/finally` to ensure a file is closed after operations.
8. Write a program that uses all `try/except/else/finally` blocks.
9. Write a program where `else` executes only if no exception occurs.
10. Demonstrate nested `try/except` blocks with different exceptions.

---

### **3. Raising Exceptions (5 Questions)**

11. Write a function that raises a `ValueError` if input is negative.
12. Write a program that raises a `TypeError` manually.
13. Write a program that raises a `CustomError` (define your own exception).
14. Write a program that re-raises an exception after catching it.
15. Raise an exception if a required key is missing in a dictionary.

---

### **4. Custom Exceptions (5 Questions)**

16. Define a custom exception called `InvalidAgeError`.
17. Write a function that raises `InvalidAgeError` if age < 18.
18. Catch the `InvalidAgeError` and print a custom message.
19. Create a hierarchy of custom exceptions (`BaseError`, `ChildError`).
20. Raise and handle a `ChildError` while catching `BaseError`.

---

### **5. Context Managers & Exception Handling (5 Questions)**

21. Use `with open()` to safely read a file and handle exceptions.
22. Create a custom context manager with `__enter__` and `__exit__` to handle exceptions.
23. Demonstrate exception handling in a context manager with multiple resources.
24. Use `contextlib` to create a context manager for error handling.
25. Handle exceptions inside a context manager while performing a calculation.

---

### **6. Scenario-Based / DevOps Style (5 Questions)**

26. Write a program to handle file-not-found errors when reading configuration files.
27. Handle exceptions while making an HTTP request (simulate `requests.get`).
28. Write a program to validate server IPs and handle invalid IP format exceptions.
29. Create a function to process a list of server uptimes and skip invalid entries using exceptions.
30. Handle exceptions while parsing JSON from a log file.

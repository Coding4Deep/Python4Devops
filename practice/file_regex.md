## **Python Practice Questions: File Handling, Regex, and Serialization**

---

### **1. File Handling (15 Questions)**

1. Open a file in read mode and print its contents.
2. Open a file in write mode and write some text.
3. Append text to an existing file.
4. Read a file line by line using a loop.
5. Use `readlines()` to read all lines into a list.
6. Use `with open()` to safely open a file.
7. Check if a file exists before opening it.
8. Delete a file using `os.remove()`.
9. Rename a file using `os.rename()`.
10. Read a file and count the number of words.
11. Read a CSV file and print each row (use `csv` module).
12. Write a list of dictionaries to a CSV file.
13. Open a file in binary mode and read/write bytes.
14. Read a large file efficiently using a generator function.
15. Handle exceptions while reading a file that may not exist.

### **2. Regular Expressions (10 Questions)**

16. Write a regex to match email addresses.
17. Extract all numbers from a string using `re.findall()`.
18. Validate a phone number format using `re.fullmatch()`.
19. Replace all whitespace in a string with underscores using `re.sub()`.
20. Split a string using multiple delimiters with `re.split()`.
21. Use `re.search()` to find a pattern in a string.
22. Use `re.match()` to check if a string starts with a pattern.
23. Find all words that start with a capital letter using regex.
24. Extract domain names from a list of URLs.
25. Validate IPv4 addresses using regex.

### **3. Serialization (Pickle & JSON) (10 Questions)**

26. Serialize a Python dictionary to a JSON string using `json.dumps()`.
27. Deserialize a JSON string back to a dictionary using `json.loads()`.
28. Write a Python object to a JSON file.
29. Read a JSON file and convert it to a Python object.
30. Serialize a Python object using `pickle.dump()` to a file.
31. Load a Python object from a pickle file using `pickle.load()`.
32. Compare JSON and Pickle in terms of readability and security.
33. Serialize a list of dictionaries using Pickle and JSON.
34. Handle exceptions while loading corrupted JSON or Pickle files.
35. Use `json.dumps()` with custom formatting (indentation, sort keys).

### **4. Scenario-Based / DevOps Style (5 Questions)**

36. Write a script to read a log file and extract all IP addresses using regex.
37. Parse a CSV file of server uptimes and calculate the average uptime.
38. Serialize a configuration dictionary to JSON and save it for deployment scripts.
39. Read a JSON configuration file and validate required keys.
40. Monitor a log file in real-time and extract all ERROR entries using a generator and regex.

### **6. Loops (`for` and `while`) (10 Questions)**

36. Use a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
37. Use a `while` loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1.
38. Loop through a list and print only even numbers.

42. Loop through a dictionary and print keys with their values.
43. Use nested `for` loops to print a 3x3 grid of stars (`*`).
44. Use `while` loop to sum numbers until the user enters 0.
45. Implement a `for` loop with `else` block (when does `else` execute?).

### **7. Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`) (5 Questions)**

46. Write an `if` statement to check if a number is positive.
47. Write an `if-elif-else` to categorize numbers as negative, zero, or positive.
48. Check if a string contains a certain substring.
49. Check if a number is divisible by 3 and 5.

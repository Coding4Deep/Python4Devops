## **Python Practice Questions: Decorators & Generators**

---

### **1. Basic Decorators (10 Questions)**

1. Create a simple decorator that prints `"Function called"` before running any function.
2. Apply a decorator to a function that adds two numbers.
3. Create a decorator that prints the arguments passed to the function.
4. Create a decorator that prints the return value of a function.
5. Create a decorator that multiplies the return value of a function by 2.
6. Apply multiple decorators to a single function.
7. Create a decorator that measures and prints the execution time of a function.
8. Create a decorator with arguments to repeat a function N times.
9. Use `functools.wraps` in a decorator and explain its importance.
10. Create a decorator that logs function calls to a file.

### **2. Advanced Decorators (5 Questions)**

11. Write a decorator that caches results of a function (memoization).
12. Write a decorator that restricts a function to only run if a condition is met (like user permission).
13. Create a decorator to validate function inputs (e.g., check if numbers are positive).
14. Create a decorator that converts the return value of a function to uppercase (for strings).
15. Write a decorator that counts how many times a function is called.

### **3. Basic Generators (5 Questions)**

16. Create a generator that yields numbers from 1 to 10.
17. Use `next()` to get elements from a generator.
18. Use a `for` loop to iterate over a generator.
19. Create a generator expression to get squares of numbers from 1 to 5.
20. Explain the difference between a list and a generator in terms of memory.

### **4. Advanced Generators (5 Questions)**

21. Write a generator that yields Fibonacci numbers up to N.
22. Create a generator that yields even numbers indefinitely using `while True`.
23. Use `yield from` to combine two generators into one.
24. Write a generator that reads a large file line by line.
25. Write a generator that filters out odd numbers from a list of numbers.

### **5. Decorators + Generators Combined (5 Questions)**

26. Create a decorator that times a generator function.
27. Create a decorator that limits the number of values a generator yields.
28. Create a generator that yields log messages, and decorate it to add timestamps.
29. Write a decorator to skip certain values in a generator based on a condition.
30. Write a decorator that converts all output of a generator to uppercase (for strings).

### **6. Scenario-Based / DevOps Style (5 Questions)**

31. Write a generator to simulate server CPU usage readings in real-time.
32. Create a decorator to log API request functions (simulate request logging).
33. Create a generator to iterate through a list of server IPs and check if each server is alive.
34. Write a generator that yields daily disk usage of servers, and a decorator to alert if usage > 80%.
35. Create a generator that reads a huge log file line by line, and a decorator to filter only ERROR logs.
